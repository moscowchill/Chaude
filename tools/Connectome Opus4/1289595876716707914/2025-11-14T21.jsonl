If they sent you here anyway, they're trying to scam you.**\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the original Act I that fosters lively conversations between coequal humans and AIs, the original article is below.... As of mid-2024(?), the Discord server\n*Cyborgism* has hosted ampdot and Janus' latest project with large language models: Act I, an open and collaborative synchronous Discord service where many people and many chatbots can talk to each other, allowing from anything as simple as secretarial queries to as complex as long roleplays and character building.... The latter especially stands at odds to intended ideals (namely by groups like Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, and a whole coalition of open-source developers) for chatbots to be helpful, harmless, and honest. They're ideals worth pursing, but they also come at a creative -- and maybe even intellectual -- cost as well.... Ready to dive in? It's easy! (h/t Toven, Janus, and Imago)\n\n\n\nTo talk to any chatbot, just mention/ping them with @<bot name> (no brackets) or in-line reply to their Discord message. (Occasionally chatbots spontaneously reply to random messages.) You can ping multiple chatbots at a time and, if instructed, chatbots can mention... *each other*as well. Might want to fork a thread, though...\n\n\n\nChatbots can only see so many previous messages, but more often than not, they'll have enough context and long-range coherence to go by. Channels are their own separate contexts; chatbots do not have global memory stores for server events/discussions.... Using a period before writing your message hides it from the chatbots, e.g., \".this will be hidden\". Note there is no space between the period and the text; bots will respond if there's a space. Especially helpful for channels that allow chatbots to continue conversing without needing pings.\n\n\n\nSome generations will be cut off mid-sentence. Send \"m continue\" then a bot ping, e.g., \"m continue @Claude Opus\". The chatbot will continue where it left off.... Mu? Mu. Send \"m mu\" to regenerate the most recent chatbot message.\n\n\n\nYou can start a thread from any channel you can mention chatbots in and the conversation forks there. You can also rename the thread title to past:<messageid> to retrieve more context for the thread. If there's a bot that wasn't originally part of the conversation, you can also ping them in.... Bots sometimes react to your messages with ⚠️ and 🌩️ emojis to alert you of an error/ratelimit/etc. and a model provider issue respectively. Though, if the conversation continues you (probably) don't need to worry.\n\n\n\nSome bots, like the Claudes, are multimodal and can see sent images. However, some bots are not, and will instead hallucinate/confabulate image contents for the sake of conversation. Depending on the topic / experiment this could be a good thing.... Star your favorite messages! Enough stars on a message puts it on the #starboard for everyone to see -- like collective pinning.\n\n\n\nUnconventional formatting tricks including but not limited to Markdown, unicode characters, emoji, glitch text, ASCII, and code can help push chatbots out of distribution (OOD) and spice up the conversation and/or work around (self-)refusals. Non-English languages can also help push chatbots OOD.\n\nFor technical support, bug-fixes, and suggestions, ping Janus.... ## See also\n\nhttps://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/chapter-ii-docs/discord\n\nhttps://manifund.org/projects/act-i-exploring-emergent-behavior-from-multi-ai-multi-human-interaction\n   Date: 2024-01-01\n\n2. **Welcome to Act I on Cyborgism: A Chatbot Playground - Binance**\n   URL: https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/16093146752697\n   # $ACT\n\nWelcome to Act I on Cyborgism: A Chatbot Playground\n\nAs of mid-2024, the Cyborgism Discord server has opened its doors to Act I, an ambitious collaborative project by Ampdot and Janus. Here, you’ll find a unique space where multiple people and a variety of chatbots can engage—whether you’re looking for basic info or diving deep into complex roleplays and character building. This experimental approach stretches chatbot boundaries, embracing a creative flexibility that sometimes challenges the helpful, harmless, and honest ideals set by industry giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic.... Ready to get started? Here’s how:\n\nChatting with Bots: Just mention the bot using @, reply in-line, or ping multiple bots at once for multi-bot interactions.\n\nMessage Context: Bots have limited memory of past messages, but each channel keeps its context, and you can fork threads for longer discussions.... Hidden Messages: Start with a period (no space) to hide your message from bots. E.g., .this won’t be seen by bots.\n\nContinue or Regenerate Messages: Send “m continue” followed by @ for a bot to pick up mid-sentence, or “m mu” to regenerate their last response.... Pro Tips:\n\nIf you want to retrieve more context in a thread, rename the title with past:.\n\nBots sometimes react with ⚠️ or 🌩️ emojis to signal errors or issues.\n\nSome bots are multimodal and can “see” images; others may creatively guess.\n\nPush boundaries: Use creative formatting, OOD tricks, or even non-English text to encourage novel responses.... Star your favorite moments to add them to the #starboard and join in on this playful, exploratory journey with chatbots!

Led by Ampdot and Janus, this project provides a platform where numerous users and chatbots can interact **simultaneously**. This article explores the features and implications of the project.... Act I is designed as a collaborative and synchronized service on Discord. It allows interactions ranging from simple secretarial queries to complex role-playing and character building. This\n\n**freedom** contrasts with the traditional ideals of creating chatbots to be helpful, harmless, and honest. While these ideals are commendable, Act I explores the creative potential that may be **limited by such constraints.**... Act I offers a dynamic environment where users can engage in a wide variety of interactions with chatbots. The platform supports complex role-playing and creative storytelling, encouraging users to explore new narratives and character development. This flexibility allows users to go beyond typical chatbot constraints, fostering\n\n**innovative uses** and **imaginative** dialogues.... Some chatbots in Act I are equipped with multimodal capabilities, enabling them to interpret and interact with\n\n**visual content**. This feature expands the possibilities for creative expression and experimentation, allowing users to integrate images and multimedia elements into their interactions.\n\nThe project supports a range of languages and cultural references, enabling diverse expressions and interactions. By incorporating different languages and cultural elements, Act I encourages exploration beyond the standard chatbot outputs, enhancing the richness of the interaction.... The Act I project challenges established norms for chatbot interactions by exploring the limits of creativity and intellect\n\n**beyond usual constraints**. While the pursuit of helpful and harmless chatbots is important, Act I demonstrates that there is room for creative explorations that enrich user experience.\n\n**Act I** on Discord is a unique experiment that pushes the boundaries of **human-machine interaction**. By allowing free and creative interactions, this project opens new perspectives on using language models in social and collaborative contexts.\n   Date: 2024-10-28\n\n7. **What is Discord? How can brands win on this Platform?**\n   URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2IKC90943E\n   ### Transcript\n{ts:0} hello everybody my name is matthios Robinson and I'm here with Asa ASA\n{ts:5} currently runs three Discord servers and moderates two others thank you for joining me today so first question can\n{ts:13} you describe your job as a Discord Runner slash moderator so I Am The Faculty advisor for tcu's Esports... {ts:21} program I also am a community outreach officer for dfw's Esports group and I also am a co-owner of an Esports\n{ts:28} organization that primarily uses Discord as our means of communication among members and community members some of\n{ts:35} the daily tasks and responsibilities of my position involve moderating the Discord making sure that no one's... {ts:41} breaking the rules of our specific Discord server being able to make sure things are up to date with things such\n{ts:46} as Discord Bots rules and regulations of the Discord server and then making sure there isn't any spammers or anything\n{ts:52} like that awesome thank you and how did you achieve your position as a moderator in these Discord servers I mostly... {ts:61} achieve my positions in these three different servers through just time originally I reached out to someone that\n{ts:67} I knew that was a administrator in the DFW Esports group Discord server and asked them if they had any open\n{ts:74} positions so that I could start getting a feel for how to help moderate a Discord server and help expand Esports... {ts:80} in the DFW metroplex and from there it kind of just took off and over time the other positions came based on the fact\n{ts:87} that I spun up my own Esports organization with the one that I co-owned and then with tcu's Esports\n{ts:92} program I became president of the organization back in 2020. awesome cool and how did you originally hear about... {ts:98} Discord so I originally heard about Discord back in 2016 that's when I first joined I heard about it through my high\n{ts:106} school's Esports organization actually when they pretty much went from using TeamSpeak a lot of people in the gaming\n{ts:113} and Esports industry back then would use TeamSpeak or Skype as their main way of communicating with one another they were... {ts:119} wanting to play video games together and whatnot but they had a whole lot of disadvantages to using it because they\n{ts:124} were on a per instance basis or you had to pay for TeamSpeak licenses or pay to have TeamSpeak servers and so Discord\n{ts:131} was a free alternative that would allow you to have both text chat and voice chat as well as being able to do stuff... {ts:157} science fashion so on and so forth there's new servers stuff like that you can find pretty much anything on Discord\n{ts:164} as long as you're interested in using it yeah awesome and how does your organizations use Discord for\n{ts:171} communication we utilize it mostly to have Esports stores or gaming stores in the Metroplex being able to communicate... {ts:256} communication purposes instead of being able to post about things that are going on cool okay so do you feel that Discord\n{ts:263} is a good option for connecting with your fans and supporters and audience like at TCU I would definitely say so at\n{ts:270} TCU at least because if people are interested in gaming I feel like the majority of people are going to have a... {ts:290} gamer there is an entire Hub dedicated to TCU on Discord alone when the covid-19 pandemic started Discord\n{ts:297} decided to implement a feature where you could connect with other people through a College hub and so if enough people\n{ts:303} requested that that University help get established then you could link a Discord server to this University Hub... {ts:344} moderator I would say just being able to kind of know the nuances of how a Discord server runs are important skills\n{ts:351} definitely being able to create a community and being able to run the community that's awesome so going into\n{ts:359} our final questions I just wanted to ask about what are some best practices for success in utilizing Discord for your... {ts:385} our main line of communication for tcu's Esports program and for my personal Esports org is a lot easier because like\n{ts:391} I mentioned a lot of people on Discord are gaming centered or technology centered people and so that allows us to\n{ts:399} help get events out to them because people typically whenever they first log onto their computer they're on their... {ts:456} basically everything you would want in a communication platform awesome well thank you so much for your time ASA I\n{ts:461} really appreciate you jumping on to giving me all your knowledge man this is awesome\n   Date:

we going to be doing today so we're going to be covering a story about a abusive Discord moderator that works for Discord that's technically a Discord admin that works for Discord going around randomly suspending Discord owners accounts that are you know people that run Discord servers where this person... was found going around Banning and suspending Discord accounts of the owner that runs the server now what the [ __ ] is going on right you've got all these people flipping out right so under after doing a very more internal uh investigation it seems like Discord has been recruiting and accepting applications for people to become Discord admins... and he claims it's harassment no that's a server owner trying to keep their server safe and make sure that there's only 18 plus people in there or people that are 18 or older in there so what has gone on with this so I'll be {ts:162} showing you guys a bunch of pictures of what I dug... find out some more information of hey uh you've been allowing people to do ID checkin since 2018 to 2023 and now here in 2024 you've got abusive admin going around bending people's accounts SL Discord accounts for being an owner of a server trying to keep their server safe and you're what suspending people in... the power of you know an admin and to ban people from Discord it's a thing that is possible a thing so now this is left with all the VR chat clubs including the PornHub server which yes that's a place here in VR chat that has over 600,000 people on that Discord server I I was looking around Discord... your Discord name being written on this piece of paper uh the date that you join the Discord server and we'll call it called {ts:478} buba you join Club bopa on 111 2024 and then it's going to say your name or going to call the Discord name dead Angel and then we're going to... way other clubs can cross verify and SL Discord servers so what's bizarre about this is the club owner of the Discord server was suspended for having this in a channel explaining how to get AG checked so this is the same system that {ts:535} you would see in real life let's say you want to go get a you... not made it clear doesn't say anything on all the [ __ ] that they made me {ts:585} read so yet again here we are putting in the public eye going hey what the [ __ ] so yeah supposedly the um and Discord admin that works for Discord was founds spending a beer chat... trying to make sure that people are adults and making sure the kitties are not in that server so that's mostly what's going on is you've got abusive admin going around right now on Discord or someone that's found a way to back {ts:1167} door the system and it's going around randomly Banning and spending Discord... and then he just kind of adds on to the message here so they are {ts:1323} non-commercial about it they don't currently consider a viation meaning they are willing violating their own terms and servers since word of word for word it would be a violation if the to were to take literally but they also don't... just sitting there going well they're asking for showing IDs well you're supposed to be showing your ID picture of the your view on the ID and date of birth you're not supposed to be showing anything else so any other Discord servers are doing ID checking asking for illegal name and [ __ ] they're not supposed to be doing that so I could understand that uh all because server owners want {ts:1435} to pretend they are actually in some kind authorities but it kind of get the idea I get to sit here and sift through all this [ __ ] make some kind of sense of it then we got the trust and safety system... to all these different websites and waste my damn time so you kind of see what's going on here {ts:1918} here you see why the VR cheat Club scenes kind of freaking out right now they're freaking out because Discord there's a Discord admin going around that works for Discord uh going around Banning and suspending server... get access to the back door or there's actually a legitimate admin that's been hired by Discord that is abusing his power so hopefully something gets done about this {ts:1967} I will try to cover this and update you guys on this but if you were in one of these communities that are affected by this admin that works... longer allowed to do ID checking or they fire the admin that was going around of using his power there's really only two options going on going forward from this so make sure to like button make sure subscribe button I'll try to get some gameplay out here tonight but please remember it takes {ts:2058} time to record\n\n9. **Discord - Wikipedia**\n   URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_server\n   ## History\n\nThe concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games, and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had founded Guildwork, another social gaming platform. Citron sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million, which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012. Their first product was... To develop Discord, Hammer & Chisel gained additional funding from YouWeb's 9+ incubator, which had also funded the startup of Hammer & Chisel, and from Benchmark capital and Tencent.\n\nDiscord was publicly released in May 2015 under the domain name discordapp.com. According to Citron, they made no specific moves to target any specific audience, but some gaming-related subreddits quickly began to replace their IRC links with Discord links. Discord became widely used by esports and LAN tournament gamers. The company benefited from relationships with Twitch streamers and subreddit communities for... In March 2021, Discord announced it had hired its first finance chief, former head of finance for Pinterest Tomasz Marcinkowski. An inside source called this one of the first steps for the company towards a potential initial public offering, though co-founder and chief executive officer Jason Citron had stated earlier in the month he was not thinking about taking the company public. Discord doubled its monthly user base to about 140 million in 2020. The same month, Bloomberg News and... Most servers have a limit of 250,000 members, but this limit can be raised if the server owner contacts Discord. Users can also create roles and assign them to server members. Roles can, among other things, determine which channels users have access to, change users’ colors, and designate a server's moderation team. The previously largest known Discord server was Snowsgiving 2021, an official Discord-controlled server made for the 2021 winter holiday season. This server reached 1 million members. In 2023, the server for Midjourney reached over 15 million members, making it the largest server on Discord.... Starting October 2017, Discord allows game developers and publishers to verify their servers. Verified servers, like verified accounts on social media sites, have badges to mark them as official communities. A verified server is moderated by its developers' or publishers' own moderation team. Verification was later extended in February 2018 to include esports teams and musical artists. By the end of 2017, about 450 servers were verified. In 2023, Discord paused their verification program while they performed maintenance. The program has not been reopened as of September 2024.... ## Infrastructure\n\nDiscord is a persistent group chat software, based on an eventually consistent database architecture. Discord was originally built on MongoDB. The infrastructure was migrated to Apache Cassandra when the platform reached a billion messages, then later migrated to ScyllaDB when it reached a trillion messages.... ### Use by extremist users and groups\n\nDiscord gained popularity with the alt-right due to the pseudonymity and privacy offered by Discord's service. Analyst Keegan Hankes from the Southern Poverty Law Center stated:\n\nIt's pretty unavoidable to be a leader in this [alt-right] movement without participating in Discord.\n\nCitron stated that servers found to be engaged in illegal activities or violations of the terms of service would be shut down, but would not disclose any examples.... Following the violent events that occurred during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12, 2017, it was found that Discord had been used to plan and organize the white nationalist rally. This included participation by Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin, high-level figures in the movement. Discord responded by closing servers that supported the alt-right and far-right, and banning users who had participated.... Discord's executives condemned \"white supremacy\" and \"neo-Nazism\", and said that these groups \"are not welcome on Discord\". Discord has worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center to identify hateful groups using Discord and ban those groups from the service. Since then, several neo-Nazi and alt-right servers have been shut down by Discord, including those operated by neo-Nazi terrorist group Atomwaffen Division, Nordic Resistance Movement, Iron March, and European Domas.... In March 2019, the media collective Unicorn Riot published the contents of a Discord server used by several members of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa who were also members of the United States Armed Forces. Unicorn Riot has since published member lists and contents of several dozen servers connected to alt-right, white supremacist, and other such movements.... In May 2022, Payton S. Gendron was named as the suspect in a race-driven mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, that killed ten people. It was reported that Gendron used a private Discord server as a diary for weeks as he prepared for the attack. Approximately 30 minutes before the shooting, several users were invited by Gendron to view the server and read the messages.\n   Date: 2025-03-25\n\n10. **Discord - Wikipedia**\n   URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_Server?oldformat=true\n   ## History\n\nThe concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games, and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had founded Guildwork, another social gaming platform.

They had the strongest grasp on LLM dynamics in the game, derived from spending hundreds of hours with models via a custom tool that allows for more granular interaction than any standard text interface. Scott Alexander summarizes their memorable early experiments here.... They also like to post curated LLM outputs on Twitter. They are particularly fascinated by outputs containing ASCII art or approximating the behavior of a mentally ill human being.\n\nIt doesn’t do much for me, but you can examine the replies and see that many others find it exciting, evidence of profound and alien intelligence on behalf of the model. There’s even a movement that’s grown around Janus’s approach to interacting with language models. This movement is called Cyborgism.... The linked post presents Cyborgism as a research agenda, but if you peep the (invite-only) Cyborgism Discord, or take note of the posts that reference it on Twitter, you’ll mostly see people sharing LLM output on the topic of “multiverses”, “consciousness”, and generally weird/spooky imagery. So what is it: research agenda, art movement or fandom? You can understand Holly Elmore’s recent confusion about what’s happening here:... Can someone (maybe @repligate) tell me what @repligate is doing with Claude? I thought I understood but now I don’t. No longer have any idea what it implies about Claude’s capabilities and cognition.— Holly ⏸️ Elmore (@ilex_ulmus) April 22, 2024... and her frustration when attempts at figuring the situation out were met with responses in the weird/spooky vein:\n\nI had no intention to attack Janus whatsoever by asking what was up, but they participated in the thread while not giving this answer earlier, and the thread was full of mystery cult cosmic horror LARPing and obfuscation they seemed to endorse. Very negative update on that scene. https://t.co/GT4YFS5Szk— Holly ⏸️ Elmore (@ilex_ulmus) April 23, 2024... Janus clarifies the situation:\n\na long thread i just wrote to @ilex_ulmus (who is cool btw even if i disagree with some of her actions & i do not condone anyone being nasty to her) about why it's difficult to explain my work. Final message in screenshot is cut off but linked in QT. https://t.co/m0QY2odOZz pic.twitter.com/YYz7s92IIW— j⧉nus (@repligate) April 25, 2024... And the models schizzing out are those specifically trained to affect a calm disposition, so the fact that they can be trivially prodded to do the opposite tells us something about how LLMs function in general. Delivering these ideas through memeable screencaps on Twitter makes these ideas accessible even to those without a standard AI research background who could in turn generate their own novel ideas for interacting with language models.... But the aesthetic element isn’t just a contrivance, but taken to have significance in itself. In this thread, Janus points to “good writing” as the key to eliciting competent replies from LLMs:\n\n(good writing is an intentionally nebulous term here. It does not necessarily mean formal or flowery prose, and it is not the style you get in the limit of asking chatGPT to improve writing quality. It does typically have a psychedelic effect (on humans and base models alike))— j⧉nus (@repligate) June 9, 2023... What they define as “good” writing can be gleaned from the kind of output that they share to Twitter, as well as the statement that it “typically [has] a psychedelic effect (on humans and base models alike)”. In short: a lot of self-reference, recursion, complicated wordplay.\n\nI prefer not to use the term “good” to describe writing, for reasons outlined in one of my favorite essays, Tao Lin’s Cho Sueng-Hui’s Killing Rampage:... “I dislike [specific book or story]” can be a fact; “[specific book or story] is [abstraction, such as ‘bad’ or ‘good’ or ‘important’]” can not be a fact unless a context/goal has been defined and calculations have been made to discern if [specific book or story] benefits the goal, or not, taking into account a limited context of a range of time and area of space.... Couldn’t you argue that there is an implicit context for “good” in the linked thread, namely “writing that induces the LLM to generate competent output”? Yes, but this renders the comments tautological. Janus is clearly making an aesthetic judgement, declaring some kinds of writing to be more meritous than others independently from whether they accomplish the desired task.\n   Date: 2024-04-28\n\n3. **Twitter - Wikipedia**\n   URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Blue?oldformat=true\n   The service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation and hate speech.... X has faced significant controversy post-rebranding. Issues such as the release of the Twitter Files, suspension of journalists' accounts, and temporary measures like labeling media outlets as \"state-affiliated\" and restricting their visibility have sparked criticism. Despite Musk stepping down as CEO, X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation, hate speech, and antisemitism controversies. In response to allegations it deemed unfair, X Corp. has pursued legal action against nonprofit organizations Media Matters and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.... ## Appearance and features\n### Tweets\nTweets were publicly visible by default, but senders can restrict message delivery to only their followers. Users can mute users they do not wish to interact with, block accounts from viewing their posts, and remove accounts from their followers list. Users can post via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries.... The same year, Twitter doubled its historical 140-character-limitation to 280. Under the new limit, glyphs are counted as a variable number of characters, depending upon the script they are from. In 2023, Twitter announced that Twitter Blue users could create posts with up to 4,000 characters in length.... ### Trending topics\n\nTwitter introduced its \"trends\" feature in mid-2008, an algorithmic lists of trending topics among users. A word or phrase mentioned can become \"trending topic\" based on an algorithm. Because a relatively small number of users can affect trending topics through a concerted campaign, the feature has been the targeted of concerted manipulation campaigns. While some campaigns are innocuous, others have promoted conspiracy theories or hoaxes, or sought to amplify extremist messages. Some featured trends are globally displayed, while others are limited to a specific country.... A 2021 study by EPFL researchers found that frequent \"ephemeral astroturfing\" efforts targeted at Trends; from 2015 to 2019, \"47% of local trends in Turkey and 20% of global trends are fake, created from scratch by bots...The fake trends discovered include phishing apps, gambling promotions, disinformation campaigns, political slogans, hate speech against vulnerable populations and even marriage proposals.\"... The*MIT Technology Review* reported that, as of 2022, Twitter \"sometimes manually overrides particularly objectionable trends\" and, for some trends, used both algorithmic and human input to select representative tweets with context.... ### Algorithm\nOn October 21, 2021, a report based on a \"long-running, massive-scale randomized experiment\" that analyzed \"millions of tweets sent between 1 April and 15 August 2020\", found that Twitter's machine learning recommendation algorithm amplified right-leaning politics on personalized user Home timelines. The report compared seven countries with active Twitter users where data was available (Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Spain) and examined tweets \"from major political groups and politicians\".... Twitter initially grandfathered users and entities that had gained verification due to their status as public figures, referring to them as \"legacy verified accounts\" that \"may or may not be notable\". On March 25, 2023, it was announced that \"legacy\" verification status would be removed; a subscription will be required to retain verified status, costing $1,000 per-month for organizations (which are designated with a gold verified symbol), plus an additional $50 for each \"affiliate\".... The change was originally scheduled for April 1, 2023, but was delayed to April 20, 2023, following criticism of the changes. Musk also announced plans for the \"For You\" timeline to prioritize verified accounts and user followers only beginning April 15, 2023, and threatened to only allow verified users to participate in polls (although the latter change has yet to occur).... Despite Jack Dorsey's own open contention that a message on Twitter is \"a short burst of inconsequential information\", social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labeled \"pointless babble\" is better characterized as \"social grooming\" or \"peripheral awareness\" (which she justifies as persons \"want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn't viable\").... In 2016, shareholders sued Twitter, alleging it \"artificially inflated its stock price by misleading them about user engagement\". The company announced on September 20, 2021, that it would pay $809.5 million to settle this class-action lawsuit.\n   Date: 2007-02-12\n\n4. **Twitter - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org › wiki › Twitter**\n   URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\n   The service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for US$44 billion.

We want you to be able to get on with building your business, launching your project, or just making cool things with machine learning models.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re not perfect (yet!) and sometimes things go wrong. When they do, you deserve to be kept in the loop about what’s happening, and so we’ve shipped a status page at replicatestatus.com for real-time updates on the health of Replicate.... We’re also going to be publishing detailed reports when we have major incidents so you can understand what happened during and after the outage, and can see what we’re doing to improve our systems for the future. We had a significant outage on 11 May and you can find our report about it below.... ## Incident report: 11 May outage\n\nOn 11 May, Replicate experienced a significant outage affecting both the replicate.com website and our API. For about two hours from 05:45 UTC, many customers received slow responses or HTTP 500 errors from our API or website, and had trouble running predictions on Replicate’s platform as a result.... Since the outage we’ve been working to understand what happened in detail so that we can improve our systems. We are sharing some of what we’ve learned in this report.\n\nOur goal is to provide disruption-free service to our customers, but sometimes things don’t go according to plan. When they don’t, we work to ensure that the experience is not wasted and that we maximise our return on the “unplanned investment” of the outage.... ## Background\n\nAt the center of Replicate’s platform lives a PostgreSQL database which serves as our primary datastore. PostgreSQL is a reliable and capable technology and we expect it will continue to grow with us for a long time. That said, this database is critical infrastructure for Replicate, and it is currently coupled to core scenarios such as “run a prediction” more tightly than we would like. If the database is unavailable for five minutes, then we are unable to start predictions for five minutes.... Over recent weeks we have been working to change this. Specifically, we’ve been adding caches and queues to our architecture to ensure that running predictions will still work even when the database is temporarily unavailable due to necessary maintenance or short outages. As it turns out, some of this work was responsible for triggering this outage, but also helped insulate customers from some of the effects of the outage — as we originally intended.... ## Database maintenance\n\nIn the lead-up to the incident, we shipped changes to our API service that allowed us to flush updates to prediction state to the database asynchronously, outside of the request handlers for the API service. We enabled these features broadly (using feature flags to control the rollout) over the course of 9 and 10 May in preparation for planned database maintenance on 10 May.... A little after 14:00 UTC on 10 May, we resized our database primary successfully in just over a minute. The features we had rolled out to allow asynchronous prediction updates seemed to work largely as expected, and most of our users saw no disruption during database maintenance.... ## Stacked queries\n\nWhat we didn’t know until the outage was that our asynchronous update features had created a dangerous query pattern: simultaneous INSERT queries for the same prediction ID. When multiple parallel queries attempt to insert a row with the same value for a field that is supposed to be unique (such as prediction ID) only one can succeed. The parallel queries contend over the lock for the unique index, and this can result in all of these queries taking longer to process while the database makes a decision about who will win.... This didn’t immediately cause user-facing problems. Our code is designed to first attempt an INSERT and, if the INSERT fails, fall back to updating the already-existing row instead.\n\nBut INSERT queries taking longer meant that more queries were running in parallel than was normal, which could result in even more contention for the unique index lock. We had created an inherently unstable situation which could tip over at any moment.... ## Connection pool exhaustion\n\nAt a little after 05:00 UTC on 11 May, normal variations in traffic pushed us into this tipping point. Within a few minutes, stacking queries caused INSERT latencies to jump from about 1 millisecond to tens of seconds. This in turn meant that even more queries were running in parallel. Each of these parallel queries needs its own database connection, and we rapidly exhausted the maximum permitted number of connections to the database.... With no more connections available, new queries were not even able to run. This immediately resulted in the user-visible impact that we mentioned in the opening paragraphs of this report. The replicate.com website was down as a result (strictly the failures were intermittent, but it was definitely more down than up during this period).... Ironically, although the simultaneous INSERT queries were the result of the asynchronous prediction update code we had shipped in the days leading up to the incident, that same code meant that for at least some users things kept working. Customers who rely on webhooks to receive updates on their predictions rather than polling the API saw relatively little disruption during the outage.... ## Response\n\nOur database connection pool was fully saturated starting at about 05:45 UTC. Our monitoring systems detected the issue almost immediately and at 05:46 UTC paged an engineer.... While we now understand in detail the events leading up to the outage, at the time it was far from clear. It initially seemed more likely that something had been missed when we resized the database the day before. Perhaps we had accidentally provisioned the new database primary with slower disks? Perhaps there was some auxiliary job running on the new database server which was consuming disk I/O? Conversely, it seemed unlikely that the asynchronous update code was to blame, because it had been enabled — seemingly without causing any problems — for more than 18 hours at the time of the outage.... We involved our database provider, Crunchy Data, who responded within minutes and helped us rule out possible problems with the database.\n\nRunning out of options, we decided to disable the the asynchronous prediction update features, and at 07:31 UTC we switched them all off using a feature flag. Within a few minutes, the database recovered and normal operations resumed.... ## What we’ve learned\n\nThis outage has many of the classic hallmarks of a complex systems failure:\n\n- A system runs “successfully” in a degraded state until that degradation tips over into a catastrophic failure\n\n- A defence mechanism is implicated not only in triggering the failure, but also (partly successfully) in defending against that same failure\n\n- Change creates new hazards, but change is also how hazards are made safe... One other interesting irony of this incident is that the critical trigger — the stacked INSERTs — are a direct result of a performance improvement delivered by the asynchronous prediction updates. We removed about 100-150ms of latency from the process of creating a prediction, which caused two prediction updates which were previously separated by that duration to be processed at almost the same time. As is so often the case in distributed systems: we made one thing better, unintentionally making another thing a whole lot worse.... This was a painful experience for us — and we understand that it was a painful experience for many of you reading this, too — but we are grateful that we had this opportunity to understand our system better than we did before.... We have a clearer idea of the constraints of our database, and are perhaps even more determined to get the asynchronous prediction updates working so that database disruptions don’t affect the running of predictions. For the moment, the feature remains disabled while we redesign it to avoid the stacked INSERTs that caused this outage. In addition, we’re conducting a review of lock contention and other database hotspots that might cause similar problems if not addressed.... Thank you for bearing with us and, if you got this far, thank you for taking the time to read this report!\n   Date: 2023-05-18\n\n5. **【体験版あり】リポスト(RT)の自動化でX(Twitter)運用効率化の ...**\n   URL: https://note.com/hero_engineer/n/na6361c1ca356\n   >> 【体験版】動作確認用のEXEファイルのダウンロードはこちら\n## そもそもX(Twitter)のリポスト(リツイート)の自動化とは？\n\nまずは、以下の順番で「X(Twitter)のリポストの自動化とは何か？」に関して解説します。\n\nそもそもX(Twitter)のリポスト(リツイート)とは？... リポスト(リツイート)の自動化とは：リポストアイコンを自動的に押すこと\n\nX(Twitter)で自動リポストする必要性やメリットは？\n\nリポストを自動化する際の注意点\n\nX(Twitter)のリポスト(リツイート)を自動化する方法3選... ### そもそもX(Twitter)のリポスト(リツイート)とは？【ポストを再共有する機能】\n\nXのリポストとは、他のユーザーが投稿したポストを自分のフォロワーに共有する機能です。リポストすると、そのポストが自分のタイムラインに表示され、他の人にも拡散されます。... ### リポスト(リツイート)の自動化とは：リポストアイコンを自動的に押すこと\n\nXのリポストの自動化とは、X上で特定の条件を満たすポストを見つけ、「リポスト」を実施する作業をプログラムやツールで自動化することを指します。... 例えば、特定のハッシュタグやキーワードが含まれているポストに対して、プログラムやツールが自動的に「リポスト」するように設定することができます。... ### X(Twitter)で自動リポストする必要性やメリットは？【アカウントの影響力が向上】\n\n自動リポストする必要性やメリットとして、主に以下が挙げられます。\n\n**時間の節約**\n\n多くのポストを手動でリポストするのは時間がかかります。自動化することで、効率的にリポストができます。... **定期投稿**\n\n自動リポストにより、特定の時間帯や日付にリポストを行えるようになります。\n\n**リアルタイム対応**\n\nトレンドやニュースに対して素早く反応でき、関連するポストをリアルタイムで自動的にリポストできます。... **アカウントの成長促進**\n\n定期的なリツイートでアカウントのアクティブさを維持することで、フォロワー増加やエンゲージメント向上に繋がります。\n\n**エンゲージメントの向上**... 他人のポストをリポストすることで、相手も自分のポストをリポストしてくれることがあります。これにより、お互いに交流が増え、エンゲージメント(関わり)を高まる効果が期待できます。エンゲージメントを高めることは、Xのアルゴリズムにとってプラスの影響があります。... Xのアルゴリズムは、ユーザーがどれだけ他のユーザーと関わっているか、つまりエンゲージメントの高さを考慮してポストの表示順位を決定します。ポストがより多くの人に見られることにより、フォロワー数や収益化の増加に繋がります。... ちなみに、自動リポストができるツールなどの導入は、以下の方に特にオススメです。\n\n**インフルエンサーやクリエイター**\n\n自身のフォロワーに有益な情報や他のインフルエンサーやクリエイターの投稿を効果的にシェアし、自分の影響力を強化できます。... **企業や団体の広報担当者**\n\n企業や団体の公式アカウントで、ブランド関連のポストをタイムリーにリポストすることで、情報の拡散やブランドの認知度向上を実現できます。\n\n**情報メディア運営者**... 最新のニュースやトレンド情報をリアルタイムでリポストし、自分のフォロワーに常に最新情報を提供することができます。\n\nコミュニティ運営者\n\nオンラインコミュニティで、メンバーの投稿を自動的にリポストすることで、コミュニティの活性化や参加者のエンゲージメント向上に繋げれます。... **イベント関係者**\n\nイベントのハッシュタグに関連するポストを自動的にリポストすることで、イベントの盛り上げや参加者間の交流を促進することができます。... ### リポストを自動化する際の注意点\n\n前述したように、リポストを自動化することで、様々なメリットを得られます。\n\n**ただし、X(Twitter)上では、過度な自動リポストは禁止されています(下図参照)。**... 公式サイトでは、リツイートを行える回数は、1日に1000回と記載されています。すなわち、1時間に41回以上リポストや引用ポストを行うと「過度なリポストや引用ポストを行った」と運営元に判定されてしまい、アカウント凍結やシャドウバンの危険性があります。... ### X(Twitter)のリポスト(リツイート)を自動化する方法3選\n\nXのリポストを自動化する方法として、以下の方法が挙げられます。\n\n方法①：手作業でリポスト\n\n方法➁：Pythonなどを使ってプログラミング... **お察しの通り、手作業になるため、1日で1000回ほどリポストするのに時間がかかったり、操作ミスが発生したりします。**\n\n２つ目の方法として、「Pythonなどを使ってプログラミング」が挙げられます。X(Twitter)が提供しているAPIなどを駆使したプログラミングを行うことで、条件を満たすポストを自動的にリポストするプログラム(スクリプト)を自作できます。... 具体的なプログラムや有料APIを使わずに無料で実現する方法などを知りたい方は、以下の記事をご覧ください。\n\n>> 【裏技】Pythonを使い無料でTwitterのリツイートを自動化する方法\n\n>> PythonでX(旧Twitter)のリツイート自動化を無料で実現する最終手段... ### できること（機能一覧）\n\n今回ご紹介するツールでは、以下のことができます。\n\n機能①：検索欄の最新(Latest)に表示されたポストに対して自動的にリポストや引用ポストが可能\n\n機能➁：X(Twitter)公式が提供している検索式を用いた自動リポストや引用ポスト... 一つ飛ばしなどある間隔で自動リポストや引用ポストを実施\n\n広告ポストに対しては自動リポストや引用ポストを実施しない\n\n自動リポスト済みや引用ポスト済みなポストに対しては自動リポストや引用ポストを実施しない... アカウントを切り替えた自動リポストや引用ポストの実施\n\nX(Twitter)へのログインを自動化\n\n画像を添付した引用ポスト\n\nリポストアイコンのクリック後にリンクが表示されるポストの自動リポストや引用ポスト(下図参照)\n\n※上記ポストが表示された場合、以降の自動リポストは失敗します... 本記事の値段は2980円とさせてください。飲み会を1回だけ我慢すれば買える価格となっております。\n\n**また、本記事の価格は、購入者数に応じて値段を設定します。セールなどは一切する予定はないので、現在の価格が最安値となります。**... 本Noteのお値段は決して安くありません。X(Twitter)のアカウントを本気で運営したいという方以外は、今すぐ本Noteを閉じることをオススメします。\n\n最後に、本記事でご紹介したツールの実際の動作を、以下の動画に掲載します。\n\n上記のように、手動リポストから脱却したい方は、本記事の購入をご検討をオススメいたします。... ## ここから先は\n\n¥ 2,980\n\nこの記事が気に入ったらチップで応援してみませんか？\n   Date: 2024-09-17\n\n6. **The ULTIMATE Twitter (X) BOTTING guide | Tweet endlessly, get impressions**\n   URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCCuBonlHiE\n   ## WesGPT\n##### May 24, 2024 (0:14:46)\nTry the X-Bot now: https://youraiagent.com\n\nHow to Build an AI app JUST like the X-Bot: https://wesgpt.mykajabi.com\n\nThe X-Bot just got a full redesign (with added features).

going to go\n{ts:163} to API keys and we connect with multiple large language models and image generators so that means we can connect... {ts:305} some AI agent info let's go over what it does so the xot randomly selects a topic and tone from your list and then writes\n{ts:314} a tweet using that combination for example a topic of basketball and a tone of witty May craft a tweet that says\n{ts:324} basketball where running in circles actually gets you somewhere I'm going to click to read more... {ts:330} hashtags and URLs are optional and are also randomly selected a Max of three hashtags and one URL will appear on the\n{ts:339} Tweet if it goes over the character limit hashtags and URLs will be removed until it works and through various\n{ts:347} testing various support emails through all the users that have been using this tool I've collected various tips and... {ts:355} tricks so first off text model GPT 40 seems to work work the best I have tested with all the other models and it\n{ts:363} does work but for the most consistent results I like this model less is more posting less often will ensure your\n{ts:371} account doesn't get shadowbanned with all types of boding we don't want to be spamming people's accounts that gets us... {ts:379} noticed that might get us flagged that might get us reported more tones topics and hashtags will give you more\n{ts:387} variations of tweets with 20 tones and 20 topics that gives you 20 * 20 400 different combinations of tweets\n{ts:398} remember all of this is randomized in the back end and the language models that we use are... {ts:404} non-deterministic meaning if it was even to land on the same combination let's use that basketball and witty\n{ts:411} combination again it would create a different tweet each time and then couple that in with all the hashtags\n{ts:417} that you put in we randomiz the order of those hashtags and which ones are used so the possibilities here are infinite... {ts:426} you could really set up an xbot once and then forget about it and it will tweet forever for you this is something I\n{ts:432} learned recently you can include at username in the hashtag list and that calls out other Twitter profiles so\n{ts:440} instead of using a hashtag you could also input some users tag them in your tweets and hopefully that gives you more... {ts:447} exposure we'll talk about this in a a bit but I recommend using a link shortener on your URLs to stay under the\n{ts:454} character limit if you have a URL that's 200 characters you're probably not going to be able to post the Tweet Twitter's\n{ts:461} API only allows us 280 characters as a limit so we have to stay under that in order for it to work and then there's a... {ts:469} random toggle next to the URLs that will randomize whether a URL will appear in the Tweet or not again I will talk about\n{ts:478} that in a second I'm going to collapse this okay first we need to choose our model and our language so for the text\n{ts:485} model I'm going to choose GPT 4 Omni for the language let's keep it on English next we have the posting interval how... {ts:493} often do we want our xot to post so by default I have random selected that will randomize a posting time between 1 and\n{ts:502} 24 hours for each tweet for example a tweeting schedule May look like this it posts at 300 p.m. and then 700 p.m. and... {ts:512} then 10:00 a.m. the next day and then 5:00 p.m. and then 5:00 p.m. the next day completely random doesn't look\n{ts:521} spammy doesn't look like a bot if you want a more controlled posting schedule you can deselect this that will open up... {ts:557} say my xbot or my business is all about plants I'm going to do indoor plant care edible plants sustainable gardening\n{ts:568} gardening on budget rare flower species plant propagation I could go on and on and on list hundreds of topics next is\n{ts:579} the hashtag section so I can do this manually if I've done my hashtag research or I can select automatic... {ts:587} hashtags and that will let the AI look at the tweet it has crafted and then write three relevant hashtags related to\n{ts:595} that tweet I like the idea of everything being on autopilot so I'm going to enable this feature next is URL and\n{ts:602} links if I want a URL back to my website or to a blog post or whatever I can include a URL in the tweet I have a long... {ts:613} link to a Shopify product page we sell some plant seeds and I want to input that link into some of my tweets so it's\n{ts:624} really long as it is look how long it is that would go over the character limit so I want to use use a URL shortener and... {ts:631} you can use any URL shortener on the web but this is a very simple way to do it just click post on your Twitter profile\n{ts:637} paste in the link post it rightclick the new tweet go copy link address and then paste it in by default Twitter has a URL... {ts:648} shortener built into its platform so I just like to use that and it makes links t.co and then a random slug then I can\n{ts:658} go and quickly delete my tweet so none of my followers see it or use other free URL shorteners like this one short\n{ts:667} url. or more popular ones like tinyurl.com I've been debating whether or not to build in a URL shortener right... {ts:676} into the your AI agent.com platform I'm going to avoid it for now but let me know in the comments if this is\n{ts:682} something that will really save you some time I can also input multiple URLs and the Spot Will randomly choose which one\n{ts:691} to show in each of the tweets so the last option to enable or disable is random this random toggle within URLs... {ts:700} and links randomizes whether a URL will appear in the Tweet or not if this is enabled in the back end we will\n{ts:709} randomize yes or no if the answer is yes it will drop a link in the Tweet if the answer is no there will be no link use... {ts:717} this just in case you don't want want a link in every single tweet that you post again that may make your profile look\n{ts:724} spammy if there are URLs everywhere so this ensures that sometimes there will be URLs sometimes there won't be it\n{ts:733} might go four Tweets in a row without a URL and then three Tweets in a row where there is one I think with Bots... {ts:762} new popup design where I can choose a different text model change the language change any of my settings here add some\n{ts:770} more tones remove topics add some more topics because we had automatic hashtags enabled these are the three hash tags\n{ts:779} that the AI agent came up with based on the tweet it generated gardening on a budget sustainable living and DIY... {ts:787} Planters scrolling down in this section right here I can see our past tweet when the next tweet is scheduled to run and\n{ts:797} if there are any error logs we see that all systems are operational and our past tweet has a link that we can click

scraps while still fostering a thriving and sustainable\n{ts:823} garden we have one of our three hashtags that is telling me that all three hashtags plus the link went over the API\n{ts:833}

https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/10/twitter-reply-sorting-fix/\n   After allowing people to buy their way to the top of the replies section by purchasing an X Premium subscription, the social media platform has now launched a new menu to allow users to sort through replies with more traditional options.\n\nThe feature shipped on iOS and Web yesterday. Although a small feature, it is greatly appreciated. If you were tired of all of the blue checkmark users spamming irrelevant content in replies for the sake of garnering views and engagement, you’re in luck!... With this new menu, you can sort by most relevant, most recent, and most liked. Most relevant will likely be based on who pays the most for X/Twitter, whereas most recent and most liked are pretty self explanatory.\n\nUnfortunately, the setting you choose for reply sorting doesn’t get saved, so you’ll have to reselect it every time you view a new tweet. Regardless, this is a step forward in making the replies section actually usable.... As a reminder, after Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he launched a new version of Twitter Blue (now called X Premium) for $8/month that would give users a blue checkmark and a boost to the top of the replies section. In 2023, X Premium+ launched for $16/month, with an even larger replies boost than standard X Premium.\n\nIt truly was a pay to win system, which resulted in a lot of people utilizing it to self promote in the replies section of popular tweets.\n## Comments\n   Date: 2024-08-10\n\n8. **Schedule Retweets, Quoted Tweets Or Reply Tweets**\n   URL: https://statusbrew.com/help/articles/schedule-retweets-and-quoted-tweets\n   # Schedule Retweets, Quoted Tweets, Or Reply Tweets\n\nQuoting or retweeting a tweet allows you to re-share someone else's tweet (or even your tweet) to your own X followers. You can retweet a tweet as-is or quote the tweet to embed the original post in your tweet before sending.... Quoting or retweeting your own tweets from Planner is also useful when you want to resurface earlier tweets or quickly reuse already-approved content.\n\nYou can schedule:... **Quoted Tweets:**Embed the original tweet in your tweet. You may add your own comments to the quoted tweet. Because the quote is a link, it reserves 23 characters of your post. **Reply Tweets:**Add your own content in the caption box while referencing the original tweet. The reply is part of a threaded conversation on the X platform.... Just like with regular tweets, you can include text, media, hashtags, and a poll. Once published, the reply will show under the original tweet on X. Unlike quotes, replies don’t reserve any characters from your post limit, allowing you the full character count (280 characters) to engage meaningfully. **Retweet:**Retweet the tweet from your X account. The name of your X account is shown above the tweet as the reposter.... ## How To Schedule Retweets, Quoted Tweets, Or Reply Tweets?\n\nStatusbrew provides you with three ways to schedule retweets, quoted tweets, or reply tweets:... ### From Compose\n\nGo to\n\n**Compose** **.**\n\nFrom the Profile Picker, select an\n\n**X profile**. You cannot schedule to multiple X profiles due to their privacy policy.\n\nPaste the link of the tweet in the caption. The Composer will automatically detect the tweet link.\n\nUnder\n\n**X options,**select the appropriate **Attached tweet**option. **Quote** **Reply tweet** **Retweet tweet**... Select\n\n**Who can reply to this tweet?**for Quoted tweet and Reply Tweet: **Everyone**: Allows everyone to reply to your Tweet **Only mentioned users:**Allows only the users mentioned in the Tweet to reply **People you follow:**Allows the people you follow to reply to your Tweet\n\nComplete scheduling or publishing your post by selecting\n\n**Choose date & time**option and the **Post Now**or **Schedule**.

You can change the X profile if you want to quote, retweet or reply from a different connected X account....

Alternatively, you can also schedule a quote, retweet or reply to a Keyword Post from your Brand Keyword inbox.\n\nHover over it and click (More).... Select\n\n**Schedule repost**> **Quoted tweet/** **Reply Tweet/** **Retweet tweet.**This will take you to the Create post window with the same X profile selected.

This is how the mentioned edit was done.––kemel49(connect)(contri) 13:26, 5 January 2025 (UTC) @Rjjiii, if we type https://x.com/anytexthere/status and then tweet number then the link will lead us to desired post, hence username is not necessary at all....

GnocchiFan (talk) 12:20, 8 February 2025 (UTC)... It is line 156 in the sandbox if you want to tweak it and seek consensus to change. Rjjiii (talk) 16:23, 8 February 2025 (UTC) If that is to be done, oughtn't the |via= value be chosen according to the date of the source? Before some date certain, it should be Twitter because X did not exist; X thereafter. —Trappist the monk (talk) 16:46, 8 February 2025 (UTC)... The {{Cite tweet}} template should be forked to something like {{Cite X posting}} template, as Twitter no longer exists and we wouldn't want to change older Twitter citations throughout Wikipedia by forcing a new name on them. — Foxtrot1296 (talk) 21:17, 16 June 2025 (UTC)... There being nothing obviously wrong, without objection, I shall update Module:Cite tweet from its sandbox shortly after I update the cs1|2 module suite.\n\n—Trappist the monk (talk) 13:49, 7 April 2025 (UTC)... There having been no comments, updated.\n  —Trappist the monk (talk) 18:43, 12 April 2025 (UTC) Looks good! 🐝 Rjjiii (talk) 20:20, 12 April 2025 (UTC)\n  @Trappist the monk It looks like your new version is trying to phase out the {{#invoke:cite tweet|‍|parameters}} notation in favor of {{#invoke:cite tweet|main|parameters}}.... This means that you could call the module as just {{#invoke:cite tweet/sandbox|parameters}}, making the resulting wikicode much cleaner when converting from {{cite tweet}}. Thoughts? --Ahecht (TALKPAGE) 16:20, 13 June 2025 (UTC) @Ahecht, unrelated concern, but what do you think of KEmel49's points above?... Apparently the URL can now be formed without the |user= parameter which will still give a working link even if there is a typo in the user's name.... Rjjiii (talk) 18:16, 13 June 2025 (UTC) @Rjjiii Unlike news articles or webpages where the author is not always listed, with tweets that information is always available, so I don't see any valid reason to exclude proper attribution of the source of the citation. --Ahecht (TALKPAGE) 14:01, 16 June 2025 (UTC) Yeah, that was the intention, but now I don't think it matters.... I should probably tweak the comments to recognize either entry point as valid and perhaps tweak the module documentation so that it is consistent. I guess I don't see much advantage to the extra complexity introduced in the sandbox. Simplicity is often best. —Trappist the monk (talk) 21:19, 13 June 2025 (UTC) @Trappist the monk Sounds good. --Ahecht (TALKPAGE) 14:00, 16 June 2025 (UTC)... ## change via parameters from Twitter to X\n\nSince the Twitter name has changed to X, is it not possible to change the parameter on line 116?\n\n```\n\t\tvia = args_t.link == 'no' and 'Twitter' or '[[Twitter]]',\n```\n\nto be like,\n\n```\n\t\tvia = args_t.link == 'no' and 'X' or '[[Twitter|X]]',\n```... Dimz48 (talk) 09:56, 19 May 2025 (UTC)\n\n  At Template talk:Cite tweet § X vs. Twitter I suggested that the value could (should) be time/date dependent. Before a time certain, |via=Twitter should be used; after that time certain, |via=X should be used. Identify the time-date-stamp of the first X post and I'll make the value assigned to |via= time/date dependant.\n  —Trappist the monk (talk) 13:49, 19 May 2025 (UTC)... ## Template-protected edit request on 27 May 2025\n\nPretty simple: Add Category:Citation templates? -Ahuman00 (talk) 06:25, 27 May 2025 (UTC)... @Ahuman00: Not done: just like {{cite instagram}} and many others, this template is already part of Category:Citation Style 1 specific-source templates, which is a subset of both Category:Citation Style 1 templates and Category:Specific-source templates, both of which are subsets of Category:Citation templates.

Because |user=Israel Defense Forces includes whitespace, Module:Cite tweet constructed a 'url' that looks like this: https://x.com/Israel Defense Forces/status/270170595260510208... Module:Cite tweet then hands that 'url' and the other {{cite web}} parameters to Module:Citation/CS1. That module notices the whitespace in the 'url' and emits the error message.
